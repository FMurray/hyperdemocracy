    "Below we take each row from our legislation DataFrame and create a LangChain Document. We use the `body` column for the `page_content` attribute and populate the `metadata` attribute with data from some of the other columns. Note that the `source` key in the `metadata` dictionary is associated with a congress.gov url. The `source` key can hold an arbitrary string and will become important when we look into question answering systems that return information about the sources used to answer a question. We also restrict ourselves to `str`, `int`, and `float` types in the other values of our `metadata` dictionary. This is to make it easy to use them as filters when querying our vectorstore. If that doesn't make sense, dont worry! It will by the end of the workshop.  "

    "> When you want to deal with long pieces of text, it is necessary to split up that text into chunks. As simple as this sounds, there is a lot of potential complexity here. Ideally, you want to keep the semantically related pieces of text together. What \"semantically related\" means could depend on the type of text. This notebook showcases several ways to do that.\n",

    "> At a high level, text splitters work as following:\n",
    "\n",
    ">    1. Split the text up into small, semantically meaningful chunks (often sentences).\n",
    ">    2. Start combining these small chunks into a larger chunk until you reach a certain size (as measured by some function).\n",
    ">    3. Once you reach that size, make that chunk its own piece of text and then start creating a new chunk of text with some overlap (to keep context between chunks).\n",
